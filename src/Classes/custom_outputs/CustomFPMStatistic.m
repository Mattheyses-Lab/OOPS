classdef CustomFPMStatistic
%%  CUSTOMFPMSTATISTIC class used to define custom FPM statistics for the OOPS GUI
%
%   The OOPS data and settings classes will utilize instances of this class
%   to create a set of dynamic properties, so that user-defined FPM outputs
%   can be incorporated into the software
%
%   NOTES:
%
%       StatisticFun is a function handle, it must accept exactly one input and return exactly one output
%       the input will be a 4 image stack with polarizations of 0째, 45째, 90째, and 135째
%       the output will be a single, 2D image, representing the pixel-wise computation of the statistic
%
%       after creating an instance of this class, it needs to be saved in /path_to_OOPS/assets/custom_statistics
%       to be recognized by the software, where 'path_to_OOPS' is the full path to the directory containing 'OOPS.m'
%       
%       it is recommended that the function specified by StatisticFun be saved as a separate .m file in the directory below: 
%       /path_to_OOPS/src/Classes/custom_outputs/custom_functions
%       (realistically, the function could be saved anywhere on the MATLAB PATH)
