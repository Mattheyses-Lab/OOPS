classdef CustomFPMStatistic
% class used to define custom FPM statistics for the OOPS GUI
% the OOPS data and settings classes will utilize instances of this class
% to create a set of dynamic properties, so that user-defined FPM outputs
% can be incorporated into the software

%% Notes: 
% StatisticFun is a function handle, it must accept exactly one input and return exactly one output
%   the input will be a 4 image stack with polarizations of 0째, 45째, 90째, and 135째
%   the output will be a single, 2D image, representing the pixel-wise computation of the statistic

% after creating an instance of this class, it needs to be saved in /path_to_OOPS/assets/custom_statistics
%   to be recognized by the software, where 'path_to_OOPS' is the full path to the directory 'OOPS'

% it is recommended that the function specified by StatisticFun be saved as a separate .m file in the directory below: 
%   /path_to_OOPS/src/Classes/custom_outputs/custom_functions
%   (realistically, the function could be saved anywhere on the MATLAB PATH)

    properties

        % name of the statistic (used internally by the software)
        StatisticName (1,:) char

        % display name of the statistic (used in image and plot labels)
        StatisticDisplayName (1,:) char
        
        % handle to function that will calculate the output image
        StatisticFun (1,1)

        % possible range of the output, used to scale the display properly
        StatisticRange (1,2) double = [0,1]

    end

    methods

        function obj = CustomFPMStatistic(StatisticName,StatisticDisplayName,StatisticFun,StatisticRange)
            obj.StatisticName = StatisticName;
            obj.StatisticDisplayName = StatisticDisplayName;
            obj.StatisticFun = StatisticFun;
            obj.StatisticRange = StatisticRange;
        end
