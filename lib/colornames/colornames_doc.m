%% COLORNAMES Examples
% The function <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48155
% |COLORNAMES|> matches the input RGB values or color names to the
% closest colors from the selected palette. |COLORNAMES| always returns
% the same outputs, regardless of whether matching RGB or names:
%
%  [names,RGB] = colornames(palette,RGB)
%  [names,RGB] = colornames(palette,names)
%
% This document shows some examples of using |COLORNAMES| to match
% RGB values or color names, and example usage of the bonus functions.
%% Palette Descriptions
% Palettes of named colors have been defined by various people and groups,
% often intended for very different applications. |COLORNAMES| supports a
% wide selection of common color palettes: a detailed list of the supported
% palettes is printed in the command window by simply calling |COLORNAMES|
% with no input arguments and no output arguments:
colornames()
%% Return Palette Names
% To return a cell array of the supported palettes simply call
% |COLORNAMES| with no input arguments and one output argument:
palettes = colornames()
%% Return All Color Names and RGB Values for One Palette
% Simply call |COLORNAMES| with the name of the required palette. If the
% palette name is a character vector then the color names will be a cell
% array of character vectors, otherwise the names will be a string array.
[names,rgb] = colornames("MATLAB")
%% Match Color Names
% Each input name is matched to a color name from the requested palette: an
% input name that does not match any of the color names will throw an error.
% The matching is very flexible though, as |COLORNAMES| tries to match
% regardless of spaces between words and character case. Note that
% CamelCase signifies separate words: for some palettes space characters
% may be significant (e.g. palettes |Foster| and |xkcd| ).
%
% The color names may supplied as either:
%
% * one array (either a string array or a cell array of character vectors)
% * separate input arguments (string scalars or character vectors)
[names,rgb] = colornames("xkcd",["red","green","blue"])
[names,rgb] = colornames("xkcd",'eggshell',"eggShell")
%% Match Index Number
% Palettes with a leading index number may be matched by just the number,
% or just the name, or both together (as given in the names array):
colornames("CGA",'9','LightBlue','lightblue','9 Light Blue','9lightblue')
%% Match Initial Letter
% Palettes |Alphabet|, |MATLAB|, and |Natural| also match the initial
% letter to the color name (except for 'Black' which is matched by 'k'):
colornames("MATLAB","c","m","y","k")
%% Match Diacritics
% Letters with diacritics will be matched with or without the diacritic:
colornames('SherwinWilliams','Jalape�o','Jalapeno','Ros�','Rose')
%% Match RGB
% Each input RGB triple is matched to the closest RGB triple from the
% requested palette:
[names,rgb] = colornames('HTML4', [0,0.2,1;1,0.2,0])
%% Match RGB, Selecting the Color Difference Metric
% Input RGB values are matched using one of several standard, well defined
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference color difference>
% metrics known as $\Delta E$ or _deltaE_. The default color difference is
% "CIE94", which provides good matching for most palettes and colors. Other
% deltaE calculations can be selected by using the third input argument:
rgb = [0,0.5,1];
colornames('HTML4',rgb,'CIEDE2000')
colornames('HTML4',rgb,'CIE94') % default.
colornames('HTML4',rgb,'CIE76') % i.e. CIELAB.
colornames('HTML4',rgb,'DIN99') % better than CIELAB.
colornames('HTML4',rgb,'CMCl:c')
colornames('HTML4',rgb,'RGB')
%% BONUS: View the Color Difference Metrics in a Figure
% The bonus function |COLORNAMES_DELTAE| demonstrates how the different
% deltaE metrics match the input RGB to the palette colors. Simply
% select the palette, provide an Nx3 colormap, and all deltaE metrics
% are listed with the matched colors displayed in the columns below:
colornames_deltaE('HTML4',jet(16))
%% BONUS: View the Palette Colors in 2D
% The bonus function |COLORNAMES_VIEW| plots the palettes in a figure.
% Drop-down menus select the palette, and also how the colors are sorted.
% Click on any color to view its hex RGB value (may be approximate).
colornames_view('dvips','Lab')
%% BONUS: View the Palette Colors in 3D
% The bonus function |COLORNAMES_CUBE| plots the palettes in a figure.
% The <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/data-cursor-displaying-data-values-interactively.html
% data cursor> can be used to view the color names, by clicking on the nodes.
% Drop-down menus select the palette and the color space of the colorcube:
colornames_cube('CSS','Lab')
%% BONUS: Add A New Palette
% Adding a new color palette to the tool is easy: append a suitably-named
% scalar structure array to the mat file. The structure must contain the
% following three fields:
%
% # *|names|* : an Nx1 cell array of character vectors, either written in
%               CamelCase or as space-separated initial-capitalized words.
% # *|rgb|* :   an Nx3 numeric matrix (float/integer) of the corresponding
%               RGB values, with values ranging from zero to |scale|.
% # *|scale|* : a numeric scalar, the maximum value of the RGB values.
%% Unmatched Index/Initial/Name Error
% If the input color name cannot be matched then |COLORNAMES| will throw an
% error, and displays color names that are similar to the input string/s:
colornames('CSS', 'bleu', 'blanc', 'rouge')
